I'm currently studying Computer Science at ALU Freiburg with a passion for software development and problem solving. I enjoy exploring new technologies and building useful and efficient applications. 

## :construction: **Most recent project**

[OpenStreetMapCLI](https://github.com/t-kelsey/OpenStreetMapCLI) Is a command line tool for finding things near a real-world location with OpenStreetMap. List all nearby doctors sorted by distance, along with their phone numbers, in just one command in any terminal. Or, generate maps of those locations relative to you, based on OSM tags. Make a map of all areas you can [walk your dog unleashed!] https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Tag%3Adog%3Dunleashed.
